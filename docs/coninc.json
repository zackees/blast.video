      "description": "Alex Epstein, President & Founder of the Center for Industrial Progress, explains to Glenn why Texas is currently facing an ‘extreme’ power blackout. He says energy blackouts in the Lone Star State are NOT unprecedented — in fact, they’re happening more often to industries across the state due to an increased reliance on 'unreliable' wind and solar energy. And, while this current blackout may have additional causes, this could be a warning for what's to come if the Biden administration continues to focus on ‘unreliable’ sources of energy. \n\n► Click HERE to subscribe to Glenn Beck https://bit.ly/2UVLqhL\n►Click HERE to subscribe to BlazeTV: https://www.blazetv.com/glenn \n\nConnect with Glenn on Social Media: \nhttp://twitter.com/glennbeck\nhttp://instagram.com/glennbeck\nhttp://facebook.com/glennbeck",

One of those moves takes place inside the Pentagon, with Biden’s new Defense Secretary, General Lloyd Austin, emphasizing the need to search our own military for threats — like 'extremism'…but what does that even MEAN? Plus, Glenn details the left’s latest moves to make Puerto Rico a state AND to issue new, controlling regulations on our 2nd Amendment rights. \n\n► Click HERE to subscribe to Glenn Beck https://bit.ly/2UVLqhL\n►Click HERE to subscribe to BlazeTV: https://www.blazetv.com/glenn \n\nConnect with Glenn on Social Media: \nhttp://twitter.com/glennbeck\nhttp://instagram.com/glennbeck\nhttp://facebook.com/glennbeck",

We love Trump!” people shouted as the car that Trump was riding in moved slowly by. They later erupted in chants of “USA! USA!”\n\nA number of pro-Trump and American flags were waving in the breeze.\n\nThe crowd was gathered to celebrate President’s Day.\n\nTrump was driving from the Trump International Golf Club, where he was spotted playing golf.\n\nThe drive-by evoked memories of Jan. 20, when Trump was transported past supporters to his Mar-a-Lago resort after flying to Florida from Washington.\n\nSince then, Trump has rarely appeared in public.\n\nTrump’s former and current advisers, though, have regularly appeared on TV stations and social media, saying he will be engaged to help Republicans flip the House of Representatives and Senate in 2022.\n\n---------------------\n#Trump #WestPalmBeach #PresidentsDay\n\nTrump Surprises Supporters at President’s Day Celebration | NTD\n💎Subscribe to NTD:  https://ept.ms/NTD\n\n💎Looking for real news that doesn’t spin the facts?
