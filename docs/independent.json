Six of Seven Republicans Senators are facing backlash and censure over their vote to impeach Trump.\n\nOne republican Adam Kinzinger was disavowed by his own family who wrote a scathing letter over his support for Democrats efforts to remove Trump, going as far to call for his removal from Congress.\n\nDemocrats bet big against Trump and it seems that even though the man is not president anymore they have nothing left to offer the American people. Instead they just keep pushing the orange man bad narrative which now is meaningless.\n\nBut a new poll offers hope to Trump's biggest supporters\n\n53% say they would vote for Trump as the GOP nominee for president if the primary was held today. Trump may be too old by 2024 but maybe that won't be enough to stop him running again.\n\n#Democrats\n#Republicans\n#Trump\n\nBecome A Member And Protect Our Work at http://www.timcast.com\n\nContact - Tim@scnr.net\n\nMy Second Channel - https://www.youtube.com/timcastnews\nPodcast Channel - https://www.youtube.com/TimcastIRL\n\nMerch - http://teespring.com/timcast\n\nMake sure to subscribe for more travel, news, opinion, and documentary with Tim Pool everyday.\n\nFOLLOW ME\nInstagram - http://instagram.com/Timcast\nTwitter - http://twitter.com/Timcast\nMinds - http://Minds.com/Timcast\n\nBitcoin Wallet: 13ha54MW2hYUS3q1jJhFyWdpNfdfMWtmhZ",

      "description": "Dave Rubin of The Rubin Report talks to Jeffrey Rogers Hummel (professor & author) about Abraham Lincoln, what caused the Civil War and why the North didn’t let the South secede. Jeffrey discusses how the secession of South Carolina changed the beginning of Abraham Lincoln’s presidency and put in motion what became the American Civil War. Soon after taking office Lincoln has to deal with the attack on Fort Sumter. Jeffrey discusses how the true causes of the Civil War are more complicated than just slavery. While slavery may be the main reason for the forming of the confederacy Jeffrey discusses the the impact of the fugitive slave act .According to Jeffrey figuring out what started the Civil War is not as simple as knowing why the South seceded, but also why the North felt it had to maintain the union. \n\nThis clip is from our President’s Week special in 2018 where we partnered with Learn Liberty for five episodes about five Presidents.\nWatch the full interview about Abraham Lincoln here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESp0Lea0meQ&amp;list=PLEbhOtC9klbCr0iN2ANJbaV477B0eSpc6&amp;index=6\n\nIs the state of US news driving you crazy?

      "description": "Anthony Brian Logan (ABL) debates M. Reese Everson on RT on whether or not a black actress should portray the Queen of England - Anne Boleyn.  This topic comes about due to Jodie Turner-Smith, the Jamaican / English actress from Queen and Slim, being slated to portray Anne Boleyn in an upcoming television series.  Several other works of \"art\" such as the Broadway play \"Hamilton\" have taken on the \"woke\" role of making very old stories with white characters more... \"colorful\".

Peppermint \n• Peppermint may be good for your digestive system \n\n4. Thyme \n• Thyme is antimicrobial \n\n5. Lemon balm \n• Lemon balm may help calm the nervous system, reduce stress, and promote sleep \n\n6. Rosemary \n• Rosemary is antimicrobial, and rosemary oil may help stimulate hair growth \n\nPowdered herbs that contain the most antioxidants:\n1. Clove \n• Clove is antimicrobial, it has powerful anti-parasitic actions, and it has a numbing agent that might be beneficial for a toothache\n\n2. Allspice \n• Allspice can be good for pain and inflammation \n\n3. Cinnamon \n• Cinnamon can be especially good for blood sugar issues \n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 55, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

      "description": "President Joe Biden has re-engaged with the United Nations Human Rights Council. Some of the world's worst human rights violators sit on the UN Human Rights Council, like the Chinese Communist Party. The Trump Administration and UN ambassador Nikki Haley withdrew from the council in 2018.

It comes as President Biden had a two hour long phone call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. \n\nSUPPORT US: \nPatreon.......►https://www.patreon.com/americauncovered\n\nSOCIAL:\nFacebook...► https://www.facebook.com/America-Uncovered-1819821761677650/\nInstagram..► https://www.instagram.com/americauncovered\nTwitter........► https://twitter.com/USUncovered",
