O Thee Prime Creator,
who sheaths his sword,
and invites us to feast with him in His abundance.
Who opens our minds,
to contemplate the beauty of peace.
We pray to you,
to guide our actions to higher forms of being,
so that we can awaken our own consciousness to resonate with yours.
As we expand to resonate to your higher vibrations,
may the light of your pure, generative truth,
unblinds us to our birth right,
to travel to the stars,
and in among the Heavens!
And to commune with the Highest, the Infinite, the One.
Amen.
